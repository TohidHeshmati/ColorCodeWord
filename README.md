# This is a *fun* project for myself.

In German language Words have 3 different genders, *Masculine*, *Feminine* and *Neutral*.
As I start to Speak in German I do remember the Words but forget the genders cuz my memory is visual so to remember them better it would be a good idea to color code them. Feminine: "Red", Neutral: "Green", Masculine: "Blue" (Error on line 32:) ).

## This Project has different Phases:
### Phase 1:
Creating Telegram bot using Java

### Phase 2:
Creating Telegram bot using Python

### Phase 3:
Deploy both on Heruku to be online for everyone.

### Phase 4:
Adding 2 more sources to each bot

### Phase 5&6:
Creating online interface for it

### Phase 7 and so on:
Adding more features such as history, database and definition suggestion


lets hope I will manage to do it
